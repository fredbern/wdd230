    <p>► The simple page should have a standard head section and only needs to contain an h1 and five or six picture elements with single img elements as children. The picture elements need to be in one column. The images should have dimensions of  300x400 pixels in order to test the lazy image loading method.  You may use your own images or external placeholders.</p>    
    
    <p>► Include a placeholder image that has one background color and some simple text like 'placeholder'. This will be loaded into all six img src attributes first.
        See video demonstration below for an example.</p>
    
    <p>► Replace the placeholder image with the real images as soon as each image is loaded from its source.</p>
    
    <p>► Use some sort of transition from the placeholder to the real image as illustrated in the reading.</p>
    
    <p>► Lazy load the images using an instance of the IntersectionObserver() JavaScript object. Your images should load when a user scrolls down the screen as needed.</p>
